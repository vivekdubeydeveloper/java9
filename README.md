We can write private methods in interface. private methods may be static as well as not static in interface.
Refer package com.vivek.java9.privateinfmethod

In Try with resource you can declare resource outside of try block Refer package com.vivek.java9.trywithresource


In each interface java provide method for immutable collection
We do not need to use Collections.unmodifiableList(<Pass List>)
Instead of above we can use
List.of)
Set.of()
Map.of()
